      <div class="text">
    <p>My name is Hadika Malik and I am from Manchester.</p>
    <p>I have a masters degree in Advanced Chemical Engineering but at the moment I am not working as I stay at home to look after my 1 year old son.</p>
    <p>Since I did a small module of coding in my bachelors and masters, I have been interested in pursuing it further but all the course I found were full-time, costly and did not give a chnace to learn from home. So when I heard about CodeYourFuture, I was really excited as it meant i could fulfill my wish of pursuing to learn coding software development and eventually work as that.</p>
    <p>Aside from this, I am a fully qualified personal trainer and like to keep up with my fitness however that has been a bit difficult since the birth of my son but I do still get in all the excercise from running after him all day long (just not how I prefer it, but we have to move.)</p>
    <p>I also enjoy trying new food as I belive I am a big foodie and I like to travel and explore different places. I do wish to travel the whole world one day, but one requires money for that and that too a lot, but one can dream right!</p>
    <p>Anyways, enough about me. I have included a full body workout video below for you all to try</p>
    <p>So get up and get active and get your blood pumping.</p>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
